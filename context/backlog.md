# VodaMark: Project Backlog

This document serves as a repository for features, improvements, and ideas that have been identified but deprioritized for the initial development phases. These items should be revisited periodically but should not distract from the core development priorities outlined in the main project phases.

   - Develop AI models for more robust invisible watermarks

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Implement real-time content moderation for streams using AI
   - Develop automatic content tagging and categorization

3. **Watermark Effectiveness Scoring**
   - Create an AI model to score the effectiveness and imperceptibility of watermarks
   - Implement A/B testing for watermark strategies

4. **Personalized Watermarking**
   - Develop AI models to suggest personalized watermarking strategies based on user behavior and content type

## User Experience and Interface

1. **Advanced Watermark Preview**
   - Implement real-time preview of watermarks on moving video
   - Develop a mobile AR feature for visualizing watermarks in real-world scenarios

2. **Collaborative Workspaces**
   - Create team workspaces for shared watermark management
   - Implement role-based access control for enterprise users

3. **Integration Plugins**
   - Develop plugins for popular content creation software (Adobe Creative Suite, DaVinci Resolve, etc.)
   - Create CMS integrations (WordPress, Drupal, etc.) for automatic watermarking

4. **Mobile Apps**
   - Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android for on-the-go watermarking
   - Implement mobile-specific features like camera integration for instant watermarking

## Analytics and Reporting

1. **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard**
   - Create a comprehensive analytics suite for tracking watermark performance
   - Implement predictive analytics for content protection strategies

2. **Watermark Tracking**
   - Develop a system to track and report unauthorized use of watermarked content across the web
   - Implement automated DMCA takedown request generation

3. **ROI Calculator**
   - Create tools to help users quantify the value of their watermarking strategy
   - Develop industry-specific ROI models

## Platform Expansion

1. **API Enhancement**
   - Expand the API to allow for more granular control and integration options
   - Implement a GraphQL API for more flexible data querying

2. **White-label Solutions**
   - Develop a white-label version of VodaMark for enterprise clients
   - Create customization options for branding and feature sets

3. **Localization**
   - Implement full Unicode support for watermarks in multiple languages
   - Develop region-specific features and compliance tools

Remember: Items in this backlog should be reviewed periodically but should not divert resources from the core development priorities. As the main project phases progress, some of these items may be promoted to the active development pipeline, while others may be removed if they no longer align with the project's goals.
